Firstly changed the data in with open() from single quotes to double quotes. 
Later changed "mifile.txt" to "Myfil.txt" as per the file name in the directory.(took help from channel)
Still the problem exist. Tried googling and found that it is always good o give the Absolute path of the directory rather than depending on th relative path. Hence replaced the code with Absolute path and was able to find the results.
